“Make this component/page fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Prioritize a clean layout for small screens (360–480px).
Convert fixed sizes into responsive units, stack columns vertically on mobile,
and ensure text, buttons, and spacing scale properly.
If needed, adjust padding, font-size, and flex/grid behavior.
Provide me the updated code.”
