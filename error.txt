I'll help you fix this Vercel deployment issue. The problem is clear from the error logs - let me give you the complete solution.

The Root Cause
Your build is failing because:

Vercel is trying to run npm run build
But it can't find the build script in your package.json
Even though your package.json clearly has "build": "vite build" in the scripts section
This typically happens when Vercel is looking in the wrong directory for your package.json.

Complete Fix
vercel.json
Code 
Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Add vercel.json to your GitHub repo

Create a new file called vercel.json in the root of your repository (same level as package.json)
Copy the content from the artifact above
Commit and push to GitHub
2. Update Vercel Project Settings

Go to: Project → Settings → Build & Development Settings

Set these exact values:

Framework Preset: Vite
Root Directory: ./ (make sure it's set to the root, not Weather-System)
Build Command: npm install && npx vite build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: Leave empty or set to npm install
Node.js Version: 20.x (you already have this set correctly ✓)
3. Redeploy

Go to Deployments
Click Redeploy on the latest deployment
Check "Skip build cache" if available
Why This Works
npm install ensures all dependencies (including devDependencies like Vite) are installed
npx vite build runs Vite directly from node_modules/.bin/ without relying on npm scripts
The vercel.json file explicitly tells Vercel how to build your project
Setting Root Directory to ./ ensures Vercel finds your package.json
Expected Success Log
After these changes, you should see:

✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ Running build command: npm install && npx vite build
✓ Build completed
✓ Deployment ready
Try this and let me know if you see any new errors! The deployment should work now.

Good progress! Now Vite is running, but it can't find index.html. This means your project structure has the entry file in a different location.

The search didn't find your specific repo. Let me check the typical Vite project structure. The error says Vite can't find index.html, which means either:

Your index.html is not in the root directory
Your index.html is in a subfolder (like public/ or src/)
Quick Fixes to Try:
Option 1: If index.html is in the root (most common)

Check your GitHub repo - is index.html at the same level as package.json? If yes, the issue might be with the Root Directory setting.

Make sure in Vercel settings:

Root Directory: ./ (exactly like this, with the dot)
Option 2: If index.html is inside a subfolder

Update your vercel.json:

vercel.json
Code ∙ Version 2 
Wait - before trying that, I need to see your repo structure. Can you:

Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/elfadeo/Weather-System
Take a screenshot of the file list, OR
Tell me: Where is index.html located?
Is it:

In the root? (same level as package.json)
Inside a src/ folder?
Inside a public/ folder?
Somewhere else?
Once you tell me where index.html is, I'll give you the exact fix that will work on the first try!
